A basic website that can grab any gif from giphy's api that the user types in. 

Use the search bar to type in anything that comes to mind and gifs will be placed on the screen. 

Made with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JS. 

- Need to fix viewport issue with white space on all sides
- Have the gif title and rating be placed along with the gif (I have the title, however all titles 
  become placed underneath the gif.)
- Have the images be in a square container
